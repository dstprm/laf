# Server Restart Required

## Issue

The Prisma Client needs to be regenerated and the dev server restarted to pick up the new `Valuation` model.

## Solution

1. **Stop your dev server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

2. **Verify Prisma Client generation:**

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

3. **Restart your dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Test the valuation save again**

## Why This Happens

When you add a new model to Prisma schema:

1. The schema is updated ✅
2. The database migration runs ✅
3. Prisma Client is regenerated ✅
4. BUT - The running Node.js server has the old Prisma Client cached in memory ❌

The server must be restarted to load the new Prisma Client with the `Valuation` model.

## After Restart

The error should be gone and you should see:

```
[createValuation] Success: <valuation-id>
[Valuations API] Valuation created successfully: <valuation-id>
```

# Valuation Report Sharing Feature

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the valuation report sharing feature, which allows users to:

1. Preview their valuation reports from the dashboard
2. Publish reports to make them publicly accessible
3. Share read-only reports via unique links
4. View comprehensive reports with all key financial data and charts

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added two new fields to the `Valuation` model:

- `isPublished` (Boolean): Controls whether a report is publicly accessible
- `shareToken` (String, unique): A unique token for accessing published reports

**Migration**: `20251003133533_add_report_sharing/migration.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE "valuations"
  ADD COLUMN "is_published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN "share_token" TEXT;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "valuations_share_token_key" ON "valuations"("share_token");
CREATE INDEX "valuations_share_token_idx" ON "valuations"("share_token");
```

### 2. Database Utilities

**File**: `src/utils/database/valuation.ts`

New functions added:

- `publishValuation(id, userId)`: Publishes a report and generates a share token
- `unpublishValuation(id, userId)`: Makes a report private
- `getPublishedValuationByToken(shareToken)`: Retrieves a published report (public access)
- `generateShareToken()`: Generates a unique 16-character alphanumeric token

Updated `getUserValuations()` to include `isPublished` and `shareToken` fields.

### 3. API Endpoints

**File**: `src/app/api/valuations/[id]/publish/route.ts`

New endpoints:

- `POST /api/valuations/[id]/publish`: Publishes a valuation report
- `DELETE /api/valuations/[id]/publish`: Unpublishes a valuation report

Both endpoints require authentication and verify ownership before performing actions.

### 4. Reusable Report Component

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/valuations/valuation-report.tsx`

A comprehensive, reusable component that displays:

- Company information and metadata
- Enterprise value (highlighted)
- Key metrics (WACC, terminal growth rate, terminal value)
- Revenue & EBITDA margin chart
- Football field chart with scenario analysis
- Financial projections table (revenue, EBITDA, margins, FCF)
- Key assumptions section
- Professional disclaimer

The component can be used in both authenticated (dashboard) and public (shared) contexts.

### 5. Public Report Page

**File**: `src/app/reports/[shareToken]/page.tsx`

A public-facing page that:

- Accepts a share token as a URL parameter
- Fetches and displays published reports (no authentication required)
- Shows 404 if the report is not found or not published
- Includes a professional header and footer
- Features a call-to-action to create valuations
- Generates appropriate SEO metadata

**URL Format**: `/reports/[shareToken]`

Example: `https://yourapp.com/reports/Abc123XYZ4567890`

### 6. Dashboard Valuation List Enhancements

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/valuations/valuations-list.tsx`

New features:

- **Preview Button** (Eye icon): Opens reports in new tab if published, or goes to detail page
- **Enhanced Share Button**: Opens a dialog for publishing/unpublishing and copying share links
- **Published Badge**: Shows when a report is published
- **Share Dialog**:
  - Displays share link with copy button
  - Allows publishing/unpublishing reports
  - Shows preview button for published reports
  - Includes helpful notes about sharing

### 7. Success Dialog After Saving

**File**: `src/app/free-valuation/page.tsx`

Replaced the simple toast notification with a modern success dialog that includes:

- Success checkmark icon
- Clear heading and description
- **"Go to Dashboard"** button
- **"Publish & Share Report"** button
- "Continue editing" link
- Helpful tip about publishing

## User Experience Flow

### Flow 1: Saving and Publishing from Free Valuation Page

1. User completes a valuation and clicks "Save Valuation"
2. Success dialog appears with three options:
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Publish & Share Report
   - Continue editing
3. If user clicks "Publish & Share Report":
   - Report is published and share token is generated
   - Report opens in a new tab
   - User is redirected to dashboard

### Flow 2: Publishing from Dashboard

1. User views their valuations in the dashboard
2. User clicks the Share button (Share2 icon)
3. Share dialog opens showing:
   - If not published: Option to publish the report
   - If published: Share link with copy button and unpublish option
4. User can copy the link and share it with anyone

### Flow 3: Viewing a Shared Report

1. Recipient opens the shared link (e.g., `/reports/Abc123XYZ4567890`)
2. Public report page loads with comprehensive valuation data
3. No authentication required
4. Professional, read-only view
5. Call-to-action to create their own valuation

## Key Features

### Security

- Share tokens are unique and randomly generated
- Reports must be explicitly published to be accessible
- Unpublishing a report immediately makes it private
- Authentication required for publishing/unpublishing
- Ownership verification on all authenticated endpoints

### UI/UX Best Practices

- Clear visual feedback (success icons, loading states)
- Intuitive button placement and hierarchy
- Professional report design
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Helpful tips and contextual information
- Consistent color coding (green for published, blue for actions)

### Data Displayed in Reports

- Company information (name, industry, country)
- Enterprise value (prominently displayed)
- Key financial metrics
- Revenue and EBITDA projections
- Scenario analysis (football field chart)
- Financial projections table
- Key assumptions
- Professional disclaimer

## Technical Considerations

### Share Token Generation

- 16-character alphanumeric string
- Uses cryptographically random character selection
- Unique constraint enforced at database level

### Data Integrity

- All scenarios are included in published reports
- Model data and results data are preserved exactly as saved
- Reports reflect the state at the time of saving

### Performance

- Database indexes on `shareToken` for fast lookups
- Efficient queries with selective field retrieval
- Client-side state management for dialogs

## Testing Checklist

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

- Password protection for sensitive reports
- Comments/feedback on shared reports

## Conclusion

This feature provides a comprehensive solution for sharing valuation reports with stakeholders. The implementation follows best practices for security, user experience, and code organization. Users can now seamlessly save, publish, and share professional-looking valuation reports with anyone via a simple link.
